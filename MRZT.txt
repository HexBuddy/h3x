Hello, I'm Abdulrahman Maher, but you can call me HexBuddy (I'd actually prefer to call me this). An average person on the internet who hangs out with friends on <span id="c" onclick="copyToClipboard('HexBuddy127001')">Telegram</span> and enjoys Playing CTF, Discovreing The Hidden
World Of Dark Web/APTs and Programming Malware / Analysing It.
I love traveling and going to nature whenever getting a chance!
Computers is my passion. I'll be happy if you come to <span id="c"><a href="https://github.com/HexBuddy" target="_blank">my GitHub profile</a></span> and check my projects!
Want to know me more? Then let us be friends!
